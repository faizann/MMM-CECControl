# MMM-CECControl
Control your HDMI-TV to turn it on and off. It works only with another compatible module which send the correct Event to this module which can turn the TV off or on.

For example my other little Project [MMM-MotionControl](https://github.com/nischi/MMM-MotionControl "MMM-MotionControl") which turn the TV on when a person is on front of the Mirror and turn it off if they leave, all that work with a Raspberry Pi Camera.

## Screenshot
We can't do a Screenshot because it runs in the background :) It's only react on some events to turn the TV on and off.

## Dependencies
CEC-Client to send the command to the TV.

`sudo apt-get install cec-utils`
